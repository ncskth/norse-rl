    # This is the name of your project. The first time you publish this
    # package, this name will be registered for you. It will determine how
    # users can install this project, e.g.:
    #
    # $ pip install sampleproject
    #
    # And where it will live on PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/sampleproject/
    #
    # There are some restrictions on what makes a valid project name
    # specification here:
    # https://packaging.python.org/specifications/core-metadata/#name
    name="norse-rl",  # Required
    # Versions should comply with PEP 440:
    # https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/

    description="Reinforcement learning environment for spiking neural network",  # Optional
    # This is an optional longer description of your project that represents
    # the body of text which users will see when they visit PyPI.
    #
    # Often, this is the same as your README, so you can just read it in from
    # that file directly (as we have already done above)

    # Denotes that our long_description is in Markdown; valid values are
    # text/plain, text/x-rst, and text/markdown
    #
    # Optional if long_description is written in reStructuredText (rst) but
    # required for plain-text or Markdown; if unspecified, "applications should

    # You can just specify package directories manually here if your project is
    # simple. Or you can use find_packages().
    #
    # Alternatively, if you just want to distribute a single Python file, use
    # the `py_modules` argument instead as follows, which will expect a file
    # called `my_module.py` to exist:

    #   py_modules=["my_module"],
