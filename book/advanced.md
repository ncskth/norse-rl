The neuron simulator we used here is called [Norse](https://github.com/norse/norse) and is [one of many](https://github.com/norse/norse/#4-similar-work) simulators for neuron dynamics *similar* to biology.

Norse is a library for **deep learning with spiking neural networks** which, roughly, means that they provide biologically realistic neurons that can be optimized with *both* biologically plausible learning rules *and* deep learning optimizations.
