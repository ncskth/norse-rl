# Welcome to Tutorials IX: Hands-on Competition / Neuromorphic Robotics Olympics

In this session we are going to use 2 simulated physical systems, a cartpole and a Braitenberg vehicle.

## Cart Pole

Cartpole is a pendulum with a center of gravity above its pivot point. Itâ€™s unstable, but can be controlled by moving the pivot point under the center of mass. The goal is to keep the cartpole balanced by applying appropriate forces to a pivot point.

### Equilibrium Task (Task 1)



## Braitenberg Vehicle

A Braitenberg vehicle is an agent that can autonomously move around based on its sensor inputs. It has primitive sensors that measure some stimulus at a point, and actuators or effectors. In the simplest configuration, a sensor is directly connected to an effector, so that a sensed signal immediately produces a movement of the wheel.

Depending on how sensors and actuators are connected, the vehicle exhibits different behaviors (which can be goal-oriented). 

The connections between sensors and actuators for the simplest vehicles can be ipsilateral or contralateral, and excitatory or inhibitory, producing four combinations with different behaviours named fear, aggression, liking, and love. These correspond to biological positive and negative stimuli present in many animals species.
