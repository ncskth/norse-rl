    "\n",
    "In this task, you are supposed to guide a small mouse to eat as much cheese as possible! The environment itself is simple: a mouse is moving around looking for pieces of cheese spread out around it. The mouse can *smell* the cheese through two \"nostrils\": a left nostril and a right nostril. The sensors emit strong signals when they detect a cheese that is far away from the mouse's current orientation. Example: If there is a piece of cheese in a 90° angle to the *left* of the mouse, then the left nostril will emit a signal while the right nostril is silent.\n",

    "You goal? Pick up all the cheeses around the mouse - as fast as possible!\n",
