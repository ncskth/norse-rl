    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task, you are supposed to guide a small mouse to eat as much cheese as possible as fast as possible! In this environment, inspired by the one used in Task 2, the mouse not only processes 'olfactory' information (which is, by the way, enhanced by some notion of distance to cheese) but it also uses its whiskers to be able to detect walls. This sensory information will be vital to be able to find cheese in different suggested mazes.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the code cell below, you can program your \"brain\" by defining \n",
    "1. a **weight matrix** that describes synapse connectivity strength and\n",
    "2. a **neural network** that describes how signals flow from top to bottom\n",
    "\n",
    "Go ahead, try to adjust the weights and change your network below to help your mouse find its beloved cheese!\n",
    "\n",
    "**To run the code below**, 1) focus the cell with your mouse, and 2) press the <span style=\"font-size: 280%; line-height: 24px; vertical-align: bottom;\">â€£</span> button in the above panel *or* hit `ctrl+enter`.\n"
